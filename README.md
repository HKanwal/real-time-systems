# Description

This is a collection of code snippets from my University course 4AA4: Real-Time Systems and Control Applications.

Topics learned:
- Linux kernel modules
- C processes and threads
- Makefiles

# Notes

Kernal module code will not work in Windows WSL because WSL does not allow modules to be loaded. Please run on a native Linux machine instead.
